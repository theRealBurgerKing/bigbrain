2. Accessibility Strengths
The application demonstrates several accessibility strengths:

ARIA Labels: Interactive elements in all pages include aria-label attributes, improving screen reader compatibility.

Responsive Design: The use of useMediaQuery from Material-UI in pages ensures font sizes and layouts adapt to different screen sizes, benefiting users with low vision or those using mobile devices.

Keyboard Navigation: All buttons and inputs are focusable and operable via keyboard,providing convenience for disabled users

Semantic HTML: The pages use semantic elements to structure content, aiding screen reader navigation.

Error Handling: Error messages are displayed in modals or text elements with clear styling, making them perceivable to users who can see the screen.

Color Contrast: The application's color selection in certain areas demonstrates good contrast intentions. For example, the button uses white text (#fff) with a blue background (#3b82f6), which satisfied the requirement of WCAG AA. Additionally, the error message uses color: red on a white background, providing a visual distinction.

Alt Text: All pages provide descriptive alternative text for game thumbnails, ensuring that screen reader users can understand the content of the image. This provides a context-sensitive description for the image and enhances accessibility of non-text content.
